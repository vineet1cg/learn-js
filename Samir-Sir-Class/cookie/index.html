    <!-- In computing, cookies are small text files websites store on your device to remember your information and activity, enabling personalized and efficient browsing experiences. They are an essential part of how the modern internet functions, though they also present privacy considerations.
Key Functions
Cookies are primarily used for three main purposes:
Session Management: Cookies allow websites to recognize users as they navigate between different pages, so you can stay logged in, and items remain in your shopping cart without having to re-authenticate or restart your activity on each new page.
Personalization: They help sites remember your preferences, such as language settings, location, or display options, to provide a tailored user experience on future visits.
Tracking and Analytics: Many cookies track your browsing activity across one or multiple sites to provide valuable data to website owners for improving their services or to advertisers for displaying targeted, relevant ads.
Types of Cookies
Cookies are broadly categorized by their lifespan and source:
Session Cookies: These are temporary and are erased when you close your web browser. They are crucial for a website's basic functions during a single visit, like the e-commerce shopping cart.
Persistent Cookies: These remain on your device for a set period (ranging from days to years) or until manually deleted. They are used to remember you across multiple sessions, such as keeping you logged in to a website.
First-Party Cookies: These are created directly by the website you are visiting and are generally considered safe, primarily enhancing your experience on that specific site.
Third-Party Cookies: These are set by domains other than the one you are currently on, typically for cross-site tracking and advertising purposes. Due to privacy concerns, major browsers are increasingly phasing out support for these by default.
Privacy and Management
While cookies themselves are just text files and cannot carry viruses, they can collect personal data and raise privacy concerns. Users can manage or delete cookies through their browser settings to control what information is stored and shared. Many websites now display "cookie banners" to comply with regulations like the EU's GDPR, which require user consent for non-essential cookies.  -->
